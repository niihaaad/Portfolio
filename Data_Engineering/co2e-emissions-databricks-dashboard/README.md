# CO₂e Emissions Dashboard – United States

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Databricks dashboard** analyzing **CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e) emissions across the United States**.

The goal is to explore:
- Geographic distribution of emissions
- Emissions per state
- Relationship between population size and emissions
- Top emitting states and counties

The dashboard enables decision-makers to quickly identify emission hotspots and understand regional patterns.

### 🌍 Emissions per Location
Visualizes CO₂e emissions geographically across the United States.

### 👥 Emissions vs Population
Analyzes the relationship between population size and emissions per person.

**Key insight:**  
Higher population areas tend to have **lower emissions per capita**, indicating economies of scale.

### 🏭 Top Emitting Counties
Highlights the counties with the highest total CO₂e emissions.

### 🧮 Emissions Distribution by State
Shows the percentage contribution of major states to total US emissions.

## 📌 Key Insights
- A small number of states account for over **50% of total emissions**
- Urban counties dominate total emissions
- Emissions per person decrease as population increases
- Geographic visualization reveals clear regional patterns
